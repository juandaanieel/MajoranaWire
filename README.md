Hamiltonian of a Topological Rashba Nanowire

This code was designed in Jul/Aug 2018. It was developed to study Majorana Bound States in a semiconducting nanowire.
It was used to obtain some results of this well know model such as the local density of states and energy spectrum. 
Some references of this model are:

In this readme file you can find the following information:

  1) How to install.
  
  2) How to use.
  
  3) Example: Spin Orbit interaction.
  
This code is not complete in any sense. It just recovers the fundamental, but it can be improved in certain directions.

  a) Study the spectrum as a function of the parameters to explore the topological regime.
  
  b) Study of subgap states produced by a quantum dot.
