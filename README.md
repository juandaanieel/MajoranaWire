# Hamiltonian of a Majorana Wire

Majorana particles can be found in condensed matter systems as zero energy bound states. Here we develop two different codes for implement the well known model [1,2] of Majoranas. One code in python, and other in Mathematica. 

## Python implementation

The code was initally developed during Jul/Aug 2018 to study Majorana Bound States in a semiconducting nanowire following references [1,2]. 

## Mathematica implementation
